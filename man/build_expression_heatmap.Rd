\title{Build a heatmap of normalized RNA expression for selected proteins and cell types}
\usage{
build_expression_heatmap(data, proteins, cells_of_interest)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data.frame as returned by \code{load_reference()}, containing RNA expression data.}

\item{proteins}{A character vector of gene/protein names to include (must match \code{Gene.name} column).}

\item{cells_of_interest}{A character vector of immune cell types to include (must match \code{Immune.cell} column).}
}
\value{
A named list with two elements:
\describe{
\item{data}{A normalized, wide-format data.frame with scaled pTPM values.}
\item{plot}{A ggplot2 heatmap object.}
}
}
\description{
This function subsets the RNA-seq reference data by user-defined proteins and immune cell types,
performs min-max normalization of expression values (pTPM), and visualizes the result as a heatmap.
}
