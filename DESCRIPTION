Description: xEnrich provides flexible tools for performing gene and protein enrichment analysis across multiple biological reference datasets. It supports both hypergeometric and GSEA-based methods for quantifying overrepresentation in bulk tissue (e.g., Human Protein Atlas) and single-cell transcriptomic datasets (e.g., Tabula Sapiens).
